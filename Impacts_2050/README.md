Impacts 2050 is a strategic model for scenario planning built to explore alternate futures in a regional context. The model integrates socio-demographic, travel behavior, employment, land use, and transport supply variables. Impacts 2050 treats the metropolitan area as one geographic area with three distinct land use categories: urban, suburban, or rural. Residential and commercial land markets are also modeled in aggregate.
