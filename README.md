#Welcome to ARC's Guide to tools tested during the SHRP2 grant work.

### The spreadsheets reflecting inputs and outputs and the RSPM model used by ARC during the SHRP2 grant are all available on Github. In addition, the code for the scenario visualization tool will be available in the same location after ARC releases the tool in Q4 2017. The files and code available on Github and the corresponding Scenario Testing Procedures and Results technical memo should help to guide staff at peer agencies through the process of reproducing the modeling work done by ARC.  * Transit Service Growth
	 - Low: Planned growth from the Regional Plan (70%)- T1
	 - Medium: Double planned growth (140%) -T2
	 - High: Triple planned growth (210%) -T3 * Autonomous Vehicles/Carsharing
    - Low: No autonomous vehicles or carsharing available -A1
    - Medium: Limited autonomous vehicles and carsharing available –A2
    - High: Full deployment of autonomous vehicles and carsharing – A3 * Congestion Charges
   - Low: No congestion charges- C1
   - Medium: Limited congestion charges on limited access highways- C2
   - High: Extensive congestion charges on limited access highways, and less, but significant on arterial highways- C3

   All other combinations are permutations available within the online scenario visualization tool. ♣	Outputs •	Columns B-T in RSPM_ARC•	REMIo	User Guide for Transight Version 3.6.5- http://www.remi.com/products/transighto	Model Inputs and Outputs- file name: REMI_ARC•	Inputs♣	Tab: REMI_Simulation inputs•	Column B lists the specific variable altered. •	Column B lists the variable type. •	Column D lists the relevant detail (age, sector etc.).•	Column E lists the county for which it was altered. •	Outputs♣	Tab: REMI_Simulation outputs
